# Sakila
 
## README

### Project Description

In this project, I used the Sakila database to complete various queries using Python in my Jupyter Notebook. The Sakila database is a sample database that contains information about a DVD rental store. The objective of this project was to gain experience using Pandas and SQLAlchemy to query and manipulate data from a database.

To get started, I downloaded the Sakila database and ERD files from the provided link. I used MySQL Workbench to test my queries and then copied and pasted them into my Jupyter Notebook to perform with Pandas and SQLAlchemy. 

### Conclusion

This project provided a great opportunity for me to gain hands-on experience using Pandas and SQLAlchemy to query and manipulate data from a database. By completing this project, I gained valuable skills in working with databases, which can be applied in a wide variety of applications.
